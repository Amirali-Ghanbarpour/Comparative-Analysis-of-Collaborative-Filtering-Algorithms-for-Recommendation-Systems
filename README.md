# Movie-Recommendation-System-Using-MovieLens

## Get Started
Jump into building a movie recommendation system with the MovieLens dataset! This project leverages 100,836 ratings from 610 users across 9,742 movies to recommend films using five algorithms: 
- Matrix Factorization (MF)
- Tuned Matrix Factorization
- Funk SVD with RPCA
- Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF)
- NCF with Contrastive Learning

Optimized for sparse data, NCF with Contrastive Learning achieves top performance with **Recall@20 of 0.3947** and **NDCG@20 of 0.2478**, ideal for high-quality recommendations.

## What You'll Achieve
- **Clean Data**: Filter sparse ratings and split data per user (**70% train, 15% CV, 15% test**).
- **Optimize Models**: Tune hyperparameters to combat overfitting and sparsity.
- **Interpret Results**: Evaluate model performance with ranking metrics like **Recall@20 and NDCG@20**.
- **Compare Performance**: Analyze accuracy, precision@20, recall@20, F1-score@20, and NDCG@20.

## Set Up Your Environment
Get the project running in minutes:

### 1. Clone the Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/movie-recommendation-system.git
cd movie-recommendation-system
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed. Install required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Download the Dataset
The notebook automatically downloads the **MovieLens ml-latest-small** dataset from GroupLens during execution. Alternatively, manually download it from [GroupLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) and extract it to `data/ml-latest-small/`.

## Understand the Results
The models were trained on a filtered dataset (~90,274 ratings) with a **70% train, 15% cross-validation, and 15% test split**. Check out the test set performance:

| Model                          | Accuracy (Â±0.5/Â±0.25) | Precision@20 | Recall@20 | F1-Score@20 | NDCG@20 |
|--------------------------------|----------------------|--------------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Matrix Factorization**       | 0.4088 (Â±0.5)       | 0.0716       | 0.3712    | 0.2400      | 0.2311   |
| **Tuned Matrix Factorization** | 0.4103 (Â±0.5)       | 0.0719       | 0.3739    | 0.2377      | 0.2372   |
| **Funk SVD + RPCA**            | 0.2251 (Â±0.25)      | 0.0621       | 0.2854    | 0.2667      | 0.1804   |
| **NCF**                        | 0.2476 (Â±0.25)      | 0.0757       | 0.3658    | 0.2658      | 0.2390   |
| **NCF + Contrastive Learning** | 0.1109 (Â±0.25)      | 0.0730       | 0.3947    | 0.2342      | 0.2478   |

## Take Action
- Choose **NCF + Contrastive Learning** for superior ranking (**Recall@20: 0.3947**, **NDCG@20: 0.2478**).
- Use **Tuned MF** for balanced performance with simpler computation (**Recall@20: 0.3739**).
- **Visualize Insights**: Run the notebook to see rating distributions and model comparisons.

## Compare with Research
See how this project stacks up against published studies:

| Paper                        | Model  | Dataset         | Metrics   | Why We're Different |
|------------------------------|--------|----------------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Xiangnan et al. (2017)**   | NeuMF  | MovieLens 1M   | HR@10: 0.71, NDCG@10: 0.426-0.450 | Our **NCF + Contrastive Learning** (**Recall@20: 0.3947**, **NDCG@20: 0.2478**) on smaller **ml-latest-small** dataset shows competitive ranking with simpler architecture. |
| **Koren et al. (2009)**      | SVD++  | Netflix (100M) | RMSE: 0.86 | Our **Funk SVD + RPCA** (**Recall@20: 0.2854**) underperforms due to smaller dataset but benefits from RPCA for sparsity. |

## Take It Further
Improve the system with these next steps:
- **Incorporate Content Features**: Add movie genres for hybrid recommendations.
- **Advanced Contrastive Learning**: Experiment with **SimCLR** for better embeddings.
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Use **grid search** or **Bayesian optimization** for tuning.
- **Attention Mechanisms**: Implement in NCF to capture complex interactions.
- **Ensemble Models**: Combine **MF, SVD, and NCF** for improved performance.
- **Scale Up**: Test on **larger datasets** like **MovieLens 1M** for generalizability.
